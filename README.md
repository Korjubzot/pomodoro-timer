# Pomodoro Timer

This project is a classic [Pomodoro Timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) designed for work or study. Use the live site [here](https://pomodoro-tailwind.netlify.app/).

## About

This project was built to better understand one of the most useful tools I've used while studying programming and languages - the humble tomato! The 25 minute sessions were fantastic to break up blocks of study into manageable chunks.

Over time, this project has become a minor testbed for learning the intricacies of CSS and TailwindCSS, and as of late it's my sandbox for improving my skils in mobile/tablet/desktop mutual design.

1. Clone and pull the repository to your machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Korjubzot/pomodoro-timer
```

2. Install dependencies.
