# Pomodoro Timer

This project is a classic [Pomodoro Timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) designed for work or study. Use the live site [here](https://pomodoro-tailwind.netlify.app/).

## About

This project was built to better understand one of the most useful tools I've used while studying programming - the humble tomato! The 25 minute sessions were fantastic to break up blocks of study into managable chunks, and it was also a fun opportunity to get to grips with the basics of Tailwind, and broader CSS principles as well.
